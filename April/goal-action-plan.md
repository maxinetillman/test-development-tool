# Goal Action Plan 

Date: 06/04/21
Accountability Partner: Max

## Goal 1 

**I want to focus on...** 

- Advanced understanding of good practices and clean, efficient code, with the ability to consciously refactor and articulate why
- Engineering mindset, with the ability to put concepts together to build more complicated applications and solve complex problems

**I will achieve this by...** 

- Finishing the front-end MVP of my personal project app with a focus on doing it properly with good practices, refactoring, and testing.

| Action      | Date |
| ----------- | ----------- |
| Finish the front end MVP of my personal project app (front-end sprint as defined in my Jira) with a focus on robust code and good practices      |    11/04    |
| Spend time examining my code and making sure that I refactor at any point where I can make it better   |   16/04      |
|  Write tests for the reducer(s) and front end components  |  20/04   |

**Updates:**

- 13/04: 
  - Front end is basically done (and was by 11/04)! I've just been majorly procrastinating on writing the readme. That's the last Jira card in my front end sprint, so once I do that, I've technically finished my front-end MVP. I have a home page, tracking page with goal form and progress page (with progress bar), and MVP-level styling (including a logo and color scheme).
  - I'm ahead of the game a bit on the testing goal. The reducer that runs all the counter/tracker logic is now extensively tested, and it's led to a bit of refactoring as well as I've identified a few edge cases in testing, and then once I TDD'd my reducer a bit to pass those edge case tests, I then had to refactor the actual app code in response to my new tightened-up reducer. I'm pretty happy that my reducer is now an impenetrable fortress, haha. It's so nice to be able to have confidence from testing!
  - STILL TO DO:
    - Write proper readme to consider front end MVP finished
    - Another once-over of the code to see other places where I could refactor
    - Learning how to use the React Native version of React Testing Library and writing some basic tests for my MVP components

## Goal 2

**I want to focus on...** 

- Strong knowledge base in fundamental programming concepts 
- Ability to self-teach and upskill at pace
- Engineering mindset, with the ability to put concepts together to build more complicated applications and solve complex problems

**I will achieve this by...** 

Sanding the rust off of my C# knowledge from earlier in cohort five as I feel like I've lost touch with it.

| Action      | Date |
| ----------- | ----------- |
| Watch the Microsoft day recordings from the bootcamp that I missed while I was off and review other C# recordings to get my head back in the C# game      |   09/04     |
| Build another basic C# ASP.NET back end from scratch, interrogating and annotating each step to cement it in my mind (either a basic one for my personal project app or a dummy one if I'm not ready with that yet)  |    14/04     |
| Deploy that back end on Azure   | 20/04        |

**Updates:**

- 13/04: 
  - I'm behind on watching the videos. I spent some time yesterday starting from the beginning of when Ben taught ASP.NET and rewatching those on 2x speed, but I've also combined that with starting my app's back end while coding along. I still haven't gotten to the Microsoft day/hosting videos or the more complicated stuff, but I'm going to take the step-by-step coding along path instead I think.
  - I've also been using the docs to work through things as well. I forgot how nice it is to go back to the docs to review things rather than trying to learn things fresh from them!
  - For the back end from scratch, I didn't account for the time it would take to set up the database side of my back end as well. It was good to get back into it though! I had to spend time deciding what tables and what I wanted in each table, setting up the Heroku side of things, and then I could get my controllers and repositories going. I was on a roll yesterday until I had a mystery error message that I haven't quite cracked, but it was the end of the day after a lot of work on it, so I'm going to go at this with fresh eyes later today.
  - I have two different tables (and associated repositories/controllers). I've never done a C# back end with more than one, so I'm anticipating a few challenges, ahem, I mean learning opportunities, while getting that all hooked up.
  - I did break my own rule and look at old code for a bit while setting up the nitty-gritty of the controllers and repositories, but I took my time and fully read and interrogated each bit so I was sure I knew what was going on in each line.
  - STILL TO DO:
    - Finish catching up on the videos (I haven't gotten to the ones I missed yet)
    - Code my back end along with the info in the videos
    - Deploy (gulp)

# Review with Accountability Partner

Review Goals and actions with Accountability Partner. 

- How did the month go?
- Were goal actions completed by the date? 
- If all goals were achieved, do you feel confident in signing off yourself in that area? 

## Feedback from Partner

- Check-in w/ Max 13/04: Good feedback! Nice discussion as well around readjusting the scope of goals, including discovering new actions/elements of them (e.g. needing time to set up the DB) that we didn't anticipate when setting actions and getting more information about what's realistic (e.g. three hours of something might be unrealistic, but one hour is doable).
