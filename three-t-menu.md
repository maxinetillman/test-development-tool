# The Three T's 

## Technical, Teaching, Team 

Pick three points you would like to improve. 

Remember it doesn't need to be one from each area; you can read through and pick any
you feel would help you develop into a more confident and skilled coach and developer. 

### Goals must be: 
- **S** = Specific, clear goal 
- **M** = Measurable, must be able to track progress
- **A** = Attainable, keep it realistic 
- **R** = Relevant 
- **T** = Time-bound, create realistic timelines for all your actions


### Technical

### Teaching
